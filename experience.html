			<p><br>The Young Entrepreneur Leadership Launchpad (YELL) Program is a unique class designed to inspire the next generation of entrepreneurs by encouraging innovation and incorporating hands-on learning. The first half of the course is dedicated to developing the necessary skills and knowledge to become one’s very own entrepreneur, and in the latter half, students in teams are challenged to devise their own business model. At the end of the program, students showcase what they have learned throughout the program in the annual YELL Venture Challenge where teams pitch their business idea to a panel of judges and follow up in a question and answer period.</p>
